    What is the keyword used to define a function in Python?
    
    - [x] def
    - [ ] function
    - [ ] define
    - [ ] func
    
    !!! answer
        Correct! The `def` keyword is used to define functions in Python.

### Application Exercise

!!! exercise text short "Write a Function"
    
    Write a simple Python function that takes a name as a parameter and returns a greeting:
    
    !!! answer
        Here's a good solution:
        ```python
        def greet(name):
            return f"Hello, {name}!"
        ```

### Understanding Check

!!! exercise text long "Explain Parameters"
    
    Explain the difference between parameters and arguments in Python functions:

        A relational database organizes data into tables with rows and columns, where relationships between tables are established through keys. This structure provides data integrity, reduces redundancy, enables complex queries, and supports concurrent access by multiple users.

### Technical Knowledge

!!! exercise choice "Primary Keys"
    
    What is the primary purpose of a primary key in a database table?
    
    - [ ] To speed up queries
    - [ ] To store the most important data
    - [x] To uniquely identify each row
    - [ ] To create relationships with other tables
    
    !!! answer
        Correct! A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table, ensuring no duplicates exist.

### Practical Skill

!!! exercise text short "SQL Query"
    
    Write a SQL query to select all customers from a "customers" table where the city is "New York":
    
    !!! answer
        `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York';`

### Competency Check

!!! exercise self "Database Understanding"
    
    Can you design a simple database schema and write basic SQL queries?
