# Text Input Examples

Text input exercises allow learners to provide written responses, making them perfect for open-ended questions, coding exercises, and detailed explanations.

## Short Text Input

Use short text inputs for brief answers, names, or single-word responses:

!!! exercise text short "Your Name"
    
    What's your name?
    
    !!! answer
        Great to meet you! Any name you provide is perfectly fine for this example.

!!! exercise text short "Programming Language"
    
    What's your favorite programming language?
    
    !!! answer
        Excellent choice! Every programming language has its strengths and use cases.

## Long Text Input

Long text inputs are perfect for explanations, essays, or detailed responses:

!!! exercise text long "Explain a Concept"
    
    In your own words, explain what a function is in programming.
    
    !!! answer
        A good explanation might include: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It can take inputs (parameters), process them, and return an output. Functions help organize code, reduce repetition, and make programs more modular and easier to maintain.

## Code Examples

Text inputs work great for code snippets and programming exercises:

!!! exercise text short "Python Function"
    
    Write a Python function that returns the square of a number:
    
    !!! answer
        Here's a simple solution:
        ```python
        def square(x):
            return x * x
        ```
        or using a lambda:
        ```python
        square = lambda x: x * x
        ```

## Reflection Questions

Use long text for deeper thinking and reflection:

!!! exercise text long "Learning Reflection"
    
    Describe a recent learning experience you had. What made it effective or challenging?
    
    !!! answer
        Reflection is a powerful learning tool. Effective learning often involves:
        - Active engagement with the material
        - Connecting new information to existing knowledge
        - Practice and application
        - Feedback and adjustment
        - Time for processing and understanding

## Technical Documentation

Perfect for documenting processes or explaining technical concepts:

!!! exercise text long "API Documentation"
    
    Write a brief description of what a REST API is and why it's useful.
    
    !!! answer
        A good answer might include: A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing web services. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs. REST APIs are useful because they're:
        - Stateless and scalable
        - Platform independent
        - Easy to understand and implement
        - Cacheable
        - Support multiple data formats (JSON, XML, etc.)

## Mathematical Expressions

Text inputs can handle mathematical notation and formulas:

!!! exercise text short "Mathematical Formula"
    
    Write the quadratic formula:
    
    !!! answer
        The quadratic formula is: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
        This formula gives the solutions to any quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.

## Creative Writing

Encourage creativity with open-ended prompts:

!!! exercise text long "Story Beginning"
    
    Write the opening paragraph of a story that begins with: "The last person on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door..."
    
    !!! answer
        Creative writing exercises don't have "correct" answers! The goal is to encourage imagination and expression. Any creative continuation of this prompt shows engagement with the exercise.

## Features of Text Input

The text input exercises offer several useful features:

### Auto-Save Functionality
Your responses are automatically saved as you type, so you won't lose your work if you navigate away from the page.

### Responsive Text Areas
Long text areas automatically resize as you type, providing a comfortable writing experience.

### Edit After Submission
You can edit your responses even after submitting them, allowing for refinement and improvement.

### Progress Tracking
Completed exercises are tracked in your browser's local storage.

## Best Practices

When creating text input exercises:

### ✅ Do:
- Provide clear instructions
- Give examples when helpful
- Offer detailed feedback in answers
- Use appropriate input types (short vs. long)
- Consider the audience's expertise level

### ❌ Don't:
- Make questions too vague
- Expect only one "correct" answer for creative exercises
- Forget to provide constructive feedback
- Make text areas too small for the expected response

## Try It Yourself

Create your own question and answer:

!!! exercise text long "Your Question"
    
    Think of a topic you're knowledgeable about. Write a question someone could ask about it, and then provide your answer.
    
    !!! answer
        This meta-exercise helps you think about how to create effective questions and demonstrates that you understand the concept well enough to teach it to others. Teaching is often one of the best ways to deepen your own understanding!
