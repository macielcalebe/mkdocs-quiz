# Multiple Choice Examples

Multiple choice questions are perfect for testing knowledge and providing immediate feedback. Here are various examples showing different use cases and configurations.

## Basic Multiple Choice

The simplest form of multiple choice question with one correct answer:

!!! exercise choice "Basic Example"
    
    What is the capital of France?
    
    - [ ] London
    - [x] Paris
    - [ ] Berlin
    - [ ] Madrid
    
    !!! answer
        Paris is correct! It has been the capital of France since 508 AD.

## Programming Concept

Technical questions work great for educational content:

!!! exercise choice "Python Data Types"
    
    Which of the following is a mutable data type in Python?
    
    - [ ] tuple
    - [ ] string
    - [x] list
    - [ ] int
    
    !!! answer
        Correct! Lists are mutable in Python, meaning you can change their contents after creation. Tuples, strings, and integers are immutable.

## Multiple Concepts

You can test understanding of broader topics:

!!! exercise choice "Web Development"
    
    Which technology is primarily used for styling web pages?
    
    - [ ] HTML
    - [x] CSS
    - [ ] JavaScript
    - [ ] Python
    
    !!! answer
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the standard technology for styling web pages, controlling layout, colors, fonts, and visual presentation.

## True/False Style

Sometimes a simple true/false question is most effective:

!!! exercise choice "True or False"
    
    MkDocs is a static site generator.
    
    - [x] True
    - [ ] False
    
    !!! answer
        True! MkDocs is indeed a static site generator that builds fast, static HTML websites from Markdown files.

## Complex Scenario

More detailed questions for advanced topics:

!!! exercise choice "Database Design"
    
    In a relational database, what is the primary purpose of a foreign key?
    
    - [ ] To uniquely identify each row in a table
    - [ ] To speed up queries
    - [x] To maintain referential integrity between tables
    - [ ] To encrypt sensitive data
    
    !!! answer
        Correct! Foreign keys maintain referential integrity by ensuring that relationships between tables remain consistent. They reference the primary key of another table.

## Best Practices for Multiple Choice

When creating multiple choice questions:

### ✅ Do:
- Write clear, unambiguous questions
- Make all options plausible
- Provide helpful explanations in answers
- Use consistent formatting
- Test different difficulty levels

### ❌ Don't:
- Make correct answers obviously different
- Use "all of the above" or "none of the above" frequently
- Write overly complex questions
- Forget to include answer explanations

## Interactive Example

Let's test what you've learned about creating good multiple choice questions:

!!! exercise choice "Quiz Design"
    
    What makes a good multiple choice question?
    
    - [ ] Having obviously wrong distractors
    - [ ] Making the question as complex as possible
    - [x] Providing clear explanations in the answer
    - [ ] Using technical jargon without explanation
    
    !!! answer
        Excellent! Clear explanations help learners understand not just what the correct answer is, but why it's correct. This reinforces learning and helps address misconceptions.

## Styling and Appearance

The quiz plugin automatically styles your questions to match your theme:

- **Hover effects** on options
- **Color-coded feedback** (green for correct, red for incorrect)
- **Smooth transitions** for better user experience
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile devices

Try the questions above on different devices to see how they adapt!
